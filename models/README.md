## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
2. Added position-controlled actuators and joint damping and armature. Note that these values have not been carefully tuned -- contributions are more than welcome to improve them.
3. Added home joint configuration as a `keyframe`.
4. Added `scene.xml`, which includes the robot, with a textured ground plane, skybox, and haze.
